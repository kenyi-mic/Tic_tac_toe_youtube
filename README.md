# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns and compete against each other in a grid of 3x3 cells. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get three of their marks (either "X" or "O") in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
